## About

This project was created as part of the [Laptop Orchestra](https://www.scu.edu/cas/music/ensembles/sclork/) class at Santa Clara University. Our goal was to solve the problem of how to involve the audience during a musical performance. The solution we came up with was to create a polling system which could be accessed by audience members on their mobile browsers. We would poll the users every few seconds to identify what they wanted to hear in the music, and adjust accordingly based on the results.
